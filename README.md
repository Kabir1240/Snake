# Snake Game
Classic snake game, requires Python and Turtle graphics to learn. Python comes with turtle graphics preloaded, no need to import anything.  
Use arrow keys to move around.  
Make sure to write 0 in the data.txt file to reset your highscore.  
Built using python 3.10.  
  
Update:  
  -> Added an executable file. Just download the zip file, extract and run the exe. Highscores are stored in the data.txt file, don't cheat tho!  
  -> Running the exe file does open a console, but ignore that please. It's not a virus I promise :')  
  -> Removed the console from executable :)  
  -> Instead of typing out 'continue' or 'quit' after the game ends, typing 'c' or 'q' works as well. Not case sensitive.
