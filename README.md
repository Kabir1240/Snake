Make sure to write 0 in the data.txt file to reset your highscore.
Built using python 3.10.

Update:  
  -> Added an executable file. Just download the zip file, extract and run the exe. Highscores are stored in the data.txt file, don't cheat tho!  
  -> Running the exe file does open a command prompt, but ignore that please. It's not a virus I promise :')
